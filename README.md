## My First React Weather App

My first try at creating a weather app with react and node. I was recently asked in an interview how I would make this and I didn't know all the details at the time because I had never made one but I said that I was use the principles I know and research the rest. So this weekend, the day after the interview I decided to give it a go and see how it's done.

This app was made by following the steps of a great article on freecodecamp by Nishant Kumar. I'm really grateful for the contributions of others on learning platforms, they're a massive help for us who are wanting to learn and explore software in other languages we're not yet familiar with.

This app was pretty cool because Nishant introduced the openweather website where you can use hooks to connect to the API for your app. 
I'm not going to give the run through of each step in this Readme because that's all in the article. This only took a couple of hours all together so it's a great little project to do when you don't have much time.
